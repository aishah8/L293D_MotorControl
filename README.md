# L293D_MotorControl
In my robot control project, I designed the system using *Arduino, **4 DC motors, and an **L293D Motor Driver. I initially used a **simulation program like Tinkercad* to test the code before applying it physically.

The code I wrote controls the motors to move forward for 30 seconds, then backward for 1 minute, and finally alternate between left and right for 1 minute. *Arduino* sends control signals to the *L293D* to drive the motors, while the battery provides the necessary power to run the motors.

As for the connections, the motors were connected to the *L293D* using wires, and I made sure the *L293D* correctly controls the directions based on the code I wrote.
