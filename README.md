### *Robot Control Project Overview*

In my *robot control project*, I designed a system using the following components:

- *Arduino*: The main controller that executes the program and controls the motors.
- *4 DC motors*: These are the motors that drive the robot's movement.
- *L293D Motor Driver*: This component amplifies the signals from the Arduino to the motors, allowing them to move in various directions.
- *Battery*: Provides the necessary power to the motors, while the Arduino gets its power either from the computer (via USB) or an external source.

### *System Design and Functionality*

I started by using a *simulation program* like *Tinkercad* to virtually assemble the components and test the system before physically connecting them. 

The key steps in the system are:

1. *Arduino* sends control signals to the *L293D* to operate the motors.
2. *L293D Motor Driver* amplifies the weak signals from Arduino and sends them to the motors.
3. The *battery* powers the motors, while the *Arduino* provides the control signals.

### *Code and Movement Control*

The *Arduino code* controls the motors based on a simple sequence:

- *Forward* for 30 seconds
- *Backward* for 1 minute
- *Alternating left and right* for 1 minute

This movement sequence is repeated as defined in the program.

### *Component Connections*

- *DC motors* are connected to the *L293D* driver using wires.
- *L293D* is connected to the *Arduino*, sending the motor control signals.
- *Battery* powers the motors.

The *L293D* ensures the motors receive the correct voltage and current, enabling smooth movement.

### *Testing and Validation*

Using *Tinkercad, I was able to **simulate and test* the functionality of the system virtually. This allowed me to verify that the code and connections work as expected before setting up the physical components.
