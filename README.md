##L293D_motorcontrol
In my robot control project, I designed a system using *Arduino, **4 DC motors, and an **L293D Motor Driver. Initially, I used a **simulation program like Tinkercad* to virtually assemble and test the components before connecting them physically.

The project involves controlling the robot’s movement using the motors. The *Arduino* acts as the main controller, executing the program that dictates the movement of the motors. The *L293D Motor Driver* plays a crucial role in amplifying the signals sent by the Arduino to the motors, allowing them to move forward, backward, and change directions.

In the code I developed, the motors move forward for 30 seconds, reverse for 1 minute, and alternate between turning left and right for 1 minute. These movements are controlled by the *Arduino* which sends the corresponding signals to the *L293D*, which in turn regulates the movement of the motors.

The power for the motors is supplied by a *battery, while the **Arduino* receives power either from the computer via USB or an external power source. The *L293D* ensures the correct voltage and current are provided to the motors, enabling smooth movement based on the code's instructions.

To connect everything, I used appropriate wires to link the *DC motors* to the *L293D, and then connected the driver to the **Arduino. The communication between the **Arduino* and *L293D* ensures that the motor directions (forward, backward, left, right) follow the sequence programmed in the code. The battery provides the necessary energy to the motors, as Arduino alone cannot supply enough power for them to function effectively.

Using *Tinkercad*, I was able to test and verify the code’s functionality virtually, ensuring that all components would work as intended once physically assembled.
